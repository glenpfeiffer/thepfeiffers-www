      <h2>Does God Really Exist?</h2>
      <h3>Outline:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Intro
      <li>What if there is no God?
      <li>Where did the universe come from?
      <li>Did we really evolve from monkeys?
      <li>Where did we get our sense of right and wrong?
      </ul>
      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>In this essay I will not attempt to prove that God exists because is not 
      possible to prove that God does in fact exist. Instead, I will attempt to 
      prove that it is impossible for God not to exist. I will do this by asking
      four fairly complex questions and briefly discussing them. I will not however, 
      throw the book at you. There will not be multiple references to the Bible, 
      or to other works. These thoughts, come from my own head. I caution you, 
      that inspite of lack of references, do not discard this essay for it might 
      just make you think.</p>
